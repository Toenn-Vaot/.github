## Hi community üëã

Welcome to Toenn Vaot github profile,

We are happy to see you here. Let me present what we have done and what we are doing here :

## üçø Games
### [checkers](https://github.com/Toenn-Vaot/checkers)
Who has never dream to learn coding a game ? That's why this project is birth. To help another colleague about events, decide to illustrate with fun the concept.

At the end, continue to code and the game and tadaa, checkers project is now here. Not complete yet but works.

## üîê Security
### [signaturgruppen.oauth](https://github.com/Toenn-Vaot/signaturgruppen.oauth)
In mission on a Danish project, confrontate to the customer need "integrate MITID in the authenticate process". The new social identification process (MITID) just arrived and there was a litte documentation, no plugin. So decide to develop 
a package to help developers integrating MITID in their .Net applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
### [citadel-export](https://github.com/Toenn-Vaot/citadel-export)
Well, during Thales mission, we used Citadel to communicate and exchange files safely. But company migration oblige us to move to another tool. So we need to save and extract all the rooms and files exist in our Citadel environment.
Based of the work of [montag451/citadel-export](https://github.com/montag451/citadel-export), add some features and improvements to manage empty rooms and other rare scenarios.

### [download-ubereats-invoices](https://github.com/Toenn-Vaot/download-ubereats-invoices)
Every month, there is 1 day we want to forget. The accounting day, the day when you have to retrieve all the invoices, piece of papers and justify all the payments (that it in France).

When especially, you use a lot UberEats, you have one or many invoices to download and even with a business account you have not the option **Download all**. So now, I develop a little javascript script to help downloading the invoices 
of what is displayed on the screen and saved them with the naming rules defined
